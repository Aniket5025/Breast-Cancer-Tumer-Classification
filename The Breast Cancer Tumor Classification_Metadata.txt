The Breast Cancer Tumor Classification dataset typically includes the following metadata:

Number of Instances: The total number of data samples or instances in the dataset.
Number of Attributes: The total number of features or attributes describing each instance.
Attribute Information: Description of each attribute, such as mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, etc.
Class Distribution: Distribution of instances across different classes (e.g., malignant and benign tumors).
Missing Values: Information about missing values, if any, and how they are represented in the dataset.
Source: The origin or the organization that collected the dataset, along with any relevant publication or citation.
Data Format: The format of the dataset (e.g., CSV, ARFF, etc.).
Data Size: The size of the dataset in terms of file size or memory footprint.
Data Description: Additional information about the dataset, such as preprocessing steps applied, any transformations, or data augmentation techniques used.
Usage: Guidelines or terms of use for utilizing the dataset in research or applications.
Here's an example of how you might present this metadata for the Breast Cancer Tumor Classification dataset:

Number of Instances: 569

Mean perimeter
Mean area
Mean smoothness
Mean compactness
Mean concavity
Mean concave points
Mean symmetry
Mean fractal dimension
...
Class Distribution:

Malignant: 212 (37.3%)
Missing Values: None
Source: Original dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)
Data Format: CSV
Data Description: The dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Features are computed for each cell nucleus present in the image.
Usage: For research and educational purposes. Please cite the original source if using this dataset in publications.
